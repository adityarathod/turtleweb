# turtleweb
A simple webpage to allow for kids to use turtle on their iPads. Designed for a summer camp that I teach.
The code is run using Skulpt.js and the turtle outputs to a simple `<canvas>` on the page. At the moment `index.html` is directly copied from the quickstart on http://skulpt.org, but that will change eventually as I get time to improve it.
